# FinNetworks

Trying my hand at financial markets. This is a work in progress, hoping to familiarize myself with full stack data science through this projcet. Think Airflow, Dask, Amazon AWS, etc. In terms of a rough class structure my plan is something like: portfolio -> API -> Research Suite(Backtester and portfolio analysis) -> abstract model class that plugs into everything allowing for quick prototyping of new strategies. Once this is in place then I will focus on the engineering/implimentation side of things using the aforementioned frameworks.
